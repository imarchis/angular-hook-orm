angular-hook-orm
=====================
An Angular ORM wrapper that allows you to use Angular factories as entities,
and provides a way to dynamically define "hooks" between them.

Hooks are similar to DB joins, only they are not table-based restricted,
but custom to each individual entity.

Hooks are designed to offer a higher level of freedom for creating interactions between entities.
